	  The  HINT  performance analyzer.
	  HINT reveals many aspects of computer performance: operation speed,
	  precision, memory bandwidth, and usable memory size.  It is completely
	  unlike conventional computer benchmarks.  HINT measures "QUIPS"
	  (QUality Improvement Per Second) as a function of time.  "Net QUIPS" is a
	  single number that summarizes the QUIPS over time.  This file explains how
	  to run HINT, how parameters may be adjusted, and what may NOT be adjusted.
	  The faster the computer, the greater the need for high precision, fast access,
	  and large usable storage at all levels.  Unlike conventional benchmarks,
	  shortcomings in any of these will be reflected in the figure of merit
	  (Net QUIPS).
